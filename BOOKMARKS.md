## Seq2Seq
https://github.com/ematvey/tensorflow-seq2seq-tutorials has a working version of the current TensorFlow seq2seq APIs
https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html is a dataset of conversations extracted from movie scripts
https://github.com/chiphuyen/tf-stanford-tutorials/tree/master/assignments/chatbot has an script that preprocesses the Cornell corpus

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5RY_SUJih4 - Incredible talk. Uses a solid example

## Specific projects
- This tutorial shows how to use RNNs for speech recognition https://svds.com/tensorflow-rnn-tutorial/
- Skip-Thoughts model is a sentence encoder. It learns to encode input sentences into a fixed-dimensional vector representation that is useful for many tasks: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/skip_thoughts
